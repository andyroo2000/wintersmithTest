Learning to write code has been very similar to my experience learning Japanese.

Before I moved to Japan, I immersed myself as much as I could in the language and culture using every internet resource available. I knew that this type of learning would only lay the groundwork for the real learning that would happen in Japan, when my skills would really be put to the test.

Similarly, I feel that I am still laying the groundwork - this time for a carreer as a developer. I know that deeper learning will happen when I'm working, but also that it will happen much easier if I go bonkers and immerse myself as much as possible in my new language and its culture.

The other thing that feels very similar to learning Japanese is that there is not a single book that can take you from beginner to fluency. You have to cobble together every resource you can find and read things many times, understanding more each time. There were books that I understood 20% of that I now understand 80% of... and then you find more difficult books. I'm constantly reading a book that's a little beyond me and re-reading a book that used to be a little beyond me. I always wish the process was quicker, but moving forward is always the correct thing to focus on.

On that note, I'm re-reading [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and it's seeming like the best book ever. I've also been reading [Secrets of a JavaScript Ninja](http://www.manning.com/resig/), which is also fantastic, but yeah... the right book at the right time is a wonderful thing.
