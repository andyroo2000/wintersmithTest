It looks like my preparation paid off, as my first technical interview with [HackReactor](http://hackreactor.com) went really well. I nailed the technical questions and my interviewer was very nice and encouraging. I'm really getting a good feeling from HackReactor so far.

Right now, I'm now working on my take-home project, which is supposed to prepare me for my second technical interview later in the week. I won't divulge the nature of the take-home project, but it is a bit more technical than the prep material for the first interview. The requirements for the first interview were clearly spelled out, but this is more of a test to see if you can learn what is necessary to complete a real-world project. There are some very minor hints, but this project is mostly about seeing how you fend for yourself.

I'm actually taking a break from working on it right now, but it's actually a fun little project and I feel like I'm starting to get an idea of what the pace will be like once I start in January ...assuming I get in! Okay, I'd better get back to trying to make this app work.
