The past week has been a whirlwind of activity...

In the past week, I had multiple admissions interviews with [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/).

I won't go into the graphic details, but I will say that the coding challenge
was um... *challenging* for me. I worked around the clock over the Labor Day
weekend (declining to cheat by Googling solutions to the problem).

After thinking I had
solved it on my own and feeling like a genius, I realized that I was actually getting the
wrong answer... There was a logical error and I was unable to find it in time
for my interview/pairing session.

Such is life, but the experience taught me a lot.

* Working on a challenging programming problem is extremely fun!
* Using JavaScript to solve a non-trivial problem showed me that I had a very
  shallow understanding of the language.
* All of this dabbling in different languages and frameworks had not made me a
  better programmer. I needed to focus on learning a language deeply.

After some soul searching, I took stock of my current skills and decided to
make a plan to right my wrongs.

While I have some experience with Ruby and C (I took a college class - *la-ti-da*), I've mostly been interested in technologies related to JavaScript. It seems like if you want to make something really cool that runs in a browser these days, you had better have some serious JavaScript chops.

One of the big drawbacks to choosing JavaScript as my first language seems to be that there are way better learning
resources for those learning Ruby or Python. However, I feel that I know
JavaScript the best at this point, so it makes more sense to build on my strengths by sticking with JavaScript
than to start over with a language that I'm less familiar with. Also, I feel like there are already so many people learning Ruby and that the world really needs more people to
learn JavaScript. The semicolons, curly-braces, and camelCase don't scare
me, so I might as well.

After making this decision, I looked around on ye olde Google to see if anyone
had any sage advice for those wishing to *really* learn JavaScript and found
[How to Learn JavaScript Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/).

No jumping around and trying to figure out what to learn
next. There is just moving forward. And when I'm done with that, there's [Learn
Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript](http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-intermediate-and-advanced-javascript/).

So, my course is clear... I need to spend some time to master the fundamentals and
spend as much time as possible typing, tweaking and writing code. That is
perhaps the biggest thing I learned while working on the Hacker School' code challenge: 
by attempting to solve this complex problem, I gained a
more intimate knowledge of JavaScript. The syntax melted away and I just thought about the logic and how to
break the problem into smaller parts. Although I didn't solve it in time, I
thoroughly enjoyed myself and this is the feeling I should strive for while learning.
