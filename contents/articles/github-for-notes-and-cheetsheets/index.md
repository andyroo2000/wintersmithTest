I really wanted to like [Evernote](http://evernote.com/). After reading [countless articles](http://lifehacker.com/tag/evernote) about how great Evernote is, I decided to welcome  it into my digital life. I bought a premium subscription and began using it as my primary notetaking application over a year ago.

How has it worked out? Let me start by saying that the formatting options are not great. I'd like to be able to treat my notes like html or markdown rather than like a Word document. Not being able to quickly change the font size is not ideal. 

I know that it's mildly customizable, but I've never been able to get Evernote to look the way I want it to. I don't understand why it can't function like a text editor and let me choose background colors and fonts etc. I guess what I would want is something that would show me formatted markdown and then let me switch to edit mode and then back to display mode or something, but I understand that this is way too geeky for a product as mainstream as Evernote.

For that matter, I'd like to edit in Vim and view the searchable and formatable results in something else. This led me to my current solution:

* write notes in markdown using vim
* push to Github

This system has several advantages over using Evernote: 

* I can format my notes is a simple format that is readable by modern web-browsers. If I want to read a note, I can open it in Chrome and it will display all of my formatting. Clear formatting helps make my notes make sense when I'm scanning them later. Markdown encourages you to establish a heirarchy and there is support for code formatting.

* As long as I don't mind keeping my notes in a public repository on Github, it's free.

* Increasing the font size is as easy as "command+".

The big disadvantage of not using Evernote is that my notes are much less searchable. That is not terribly important to me now, as I categorize my notes so that they are easy to find without full text search.

At some point, I could make a little site out of these notes and maybe add my own search functionality. I think it would be pretty easy to make an application that was better suited for notetaking.

I have to mention that before going down this route, I gave [Geeknote](http://geeknote.me/) a try. I think it's totally cool that someone made it, but while it allows you to edit text in Vim, at the end of the day you're left with simple text inside of Evernote which is not what I want.

I just had this idea today, so it's pretty basic at the moment, but I like it already. Here are my current [notes](https://github.com/andyroo2000/notes_and_cheatsheets).
