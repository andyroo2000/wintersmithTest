After spending all day yesterday configuring Vim to my liking (I really
couldn't live without Emmet!) and wrapping my
head around some of Vim's most immediately useful features I felt a wave of
dread wash over me as I fell asleep. I had spent an entire day wrestling with
this text editor, and while I really was starting to prefer the editing and
navigation, I still felt very crippled when switching between files.

In Sublime Text, I'd hit command-P and I could do some fuzzy searching and hit enter
and be in another file as quickly as I could think about doing it. On the other
hand, even with extensions that make file navigation much easier (like
NerdTree) it's still more steps than I'm used to. As much as I need to look at
lots of different files, I was feeling that this was just not going to work for
me.

Then, like magic, I came across the excellent
[PeepOpen](https://peepcode.com/products/peepopen) plugin ($12). Twelve dollars
may seem exorbitant for a simple add-on to an open source editor, but for me,
it's all about using the best tool for the job. It seems obvious after only a
day or two with Vim that this is a much faster way of editing code. But it seems
equally obvious that PeepOpen is a much faster way of jumping between files.

People talk about the learning curve of Vim and there definitely is one.
However, after only a few minutes I immediately understood the modal interface and how to chain commands
to get around the document. The biggest hurdle for me was having to close out of
a file, look at a tree, select a file, and then open it. This is a case where
the mac-like presentation really helps my brain make sense of the information
and quickly get into another file and start editing.

Speaking of plugins and editors and such, I know some people do this already,
but I really like it when people have a continuously updated page of their blog devoted to their
workflow. It's taken a little while to find these little tools, but I love
seeing what everyone else is using to tweak out their workflow... Kind of like
how there's a site that shows you all of the guitar pedals used by famous
guitarists. I know that the gear doesn't make the player, but it's still fun to
see what everyone is using.
