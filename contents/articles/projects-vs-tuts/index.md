I've found that a huge motivator in learning to code is working on a real project and having something to show for your efforts. I've done my share of tutorials and read enough books to crush the spine of the toughest UPS delivery-person there is, but the truth is that books and tutorials can become a *huge* time-sink.

The problem is that when you learn something without a useful context (i.e. a real project), it doesn't occupy the same space in your head as the things that you actually use. Instead, those bits of random knowledge sit in the waiting room of your brain and are politely asked to leave when your brain closes up shop for the day.

That said, I'm going to be in tutorial-land for the next few days doing some [jQuery](http://zfer.us/0o7st) and [Sass](http://zfer.us/uU8RN) tuts on CodeSchool. The former is to get an overview of jQuery, so I can figure out what problems are possible to solve with jQuery. The latter is to absorb a more thorough explanation of what can be done with Sass. I've been using Sass functions and Compass mixins for a while, but I haven't completely switched all of my coding to Sass yet, and I'm interested in going all in. I'm especially interested in trying a Sass-based grid framework, like [Zen Grids](http://zengrids.com/) or [Singularity](https://github.com/Team-Sass/Singularity). I had used some regular CSS grid frameworks before, but I definitely felt dirty creating so many new divs in the HTML just to place things on the page. For me, this is probably the most compelling argument for using CSS preprocessors.

In any case, I think it's perfectly okay to dig into a tutorial or two, as long as you do it mindfully and don't let it become busy work.
