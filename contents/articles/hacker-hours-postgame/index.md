I attended my second Hacker Hours meetup tonight.

This time, I had some concrete questions... Mostly, "Was I writing the worst jQuery code ever?" I thought that I should be more aggressively refactoring my code and I suspected that I might be going about my coffee calculator all wrong. It turns out that while I was able to cache a few variables, it didn't need to be refactored much beyond that.

I also got help making a timer for my little coffee calculator. As of now, the time is in seconds and there's no way to stop or reset the timer, but it works and can accept user input, so it's a start.

The other bonus, was that I got to ask for some Sublime Text tips. I saw him moving elements up and down the page with the keyboard and my mind exploded. **FYI**: *command-ctrl-arrow moves selected text up or down like magic*, which is very useful when you decide to wrap some js code in a function and you want to move the closing brackets to the end of the function without cutting and pasting.

I actually spent a decent amount of time today working on my Sublime Text setup and reviewing the [NetTuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course/?search_index=4) videos on Sublime Workflow. I installed a few useful packages, like: [Emmet](http://emmet.io/), [Advanced New File](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/lightning-fast-folder-and-file-creation-in-sublime-text-2/), and [Align](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/alignment).

I also modified my window setup and key-bindings, so that I can manage split panels and change panel widths etc. from the keyboard. This is probably one of the biggest time savers and generally makes working with several files at once a much less frustrating experience.

Also, rewatching the video on incremental search (command-i) is really changing my life right now.

In the beginning this stuff seemed a little overwhelming, but I'm starting to get to the point where I'm comfortable enough with the basic syntax of the languages I'm learning and I want to be able to do things quicker and not be slowed down by the mental shift of having to use the track pad for everything.
