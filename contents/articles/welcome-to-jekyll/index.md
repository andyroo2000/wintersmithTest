Listening to [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54) today and it got me thinking about trying [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

This mostly came about because I've been working on a redesign of a WordPress site and aside from not loving php, I was just thinking that using a full dynamic CMS tied to a relational database seemed like overkill for something like a simple portfolio site, a product site, or *even* a blog.

Honestly, Jekyll appealed to me for several reasons:

* The structure is stupidly simple.
* It's powered by Ruby, which means that if I ever want to dig under the hood, I won't have to look at php.
* Installing the gem took all of 30 seconds.

I'm just trying it out now, but it seems promising.
