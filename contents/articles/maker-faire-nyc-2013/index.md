I was lucky enough to attend the Maker Faire this past weekend. While there were tons of people showing off circuit-bending projects and a hundred companies promoting 3-D printing, the star of the show for me was the tent showing off the latest cheap microprocessors, like the Arduino, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone.

I already knew a little about the Arduino, as it's been around for a while now, but I didn't know much about the Raspberry Pi (other than its low price of $35). There were lots of cool presentations on ways that people had programmed these things, including one by a guy who had his Raspberry Pi feeding a video projector his current speed, [which is then displayed](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/the-raspberry-pi-dynamic-headlight-can-tell-you-how-fast-youre-cycling/) in front of the bike on the ground.

And I had never heard of the BeagleBone, but their [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone+Black) seems like an interesting alternative, to the other microprocessor platforms. I watched a coding demo on the BeagleBone, and it looks very easy to develop for. To interact with the physical world (through sensors and Arduino compatible add-ons) there is a JavaScript library called BoneScript, which seems very intuitive if you have any JavaScript experience. It also comes with Angtrom Linux and the [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io) preinstalled, so you should be able to plug it into a monitor and get started.

The idea of a $35 computer that runs linux is very tempting... Of course, it could [cost more](http://www.zdnet.com/raspberry-pi-how-i-spent-almost-150-on-a-35-computer-7000020574/) after you buy accessories and other things that make it more functional.
