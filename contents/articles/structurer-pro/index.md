Okay, this has been around for a little while now, but it's new to me and I'm
loving it so much that I can't help but mention it.

It's a little Mac app from the people at [Net Tuts](http://net.tutsplus.com/)
that lets you *easily* set up templates for entire file structures. For
instance, I'm learning Angular.js at the moment and trying various tutorials
and such requires having a blank project to start working on... something with
an index.html, CSS and JavaScript files linked up and in their respective
folders and a file containing the Angular.js framework itself.

Not only can Structurer set up all of those files for me (once I set up the
template), but I can even set the local Angular.js file to be created using the
download link to the CDN, which means that every time I start a new project,
I'm getting the latest version of the framework without having to visit the
website or touch the Finder (or the terminal for that matter).

It's called [Structurer Pro](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/structurer-pro-for-premium-members/) and it's free for Net Tuts premium members, but the
free version [Structurer](http://net.tutsplus.com/freebies/others/free-mac-utility-app-structurer/) seems to have most of the features as its paid
counterpart.
