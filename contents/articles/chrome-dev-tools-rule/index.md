I was asking a friend of mine for advice on learning front-end and he gave me the usual advice (make something) peppered with a few specific tools that would make my life easier.

One of those tools was [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/), which *is* totally amazing (and which I bought after using for the trial period). The other piece of advice was to become intimately familiar with Chrome DevTools.

I thought that I more or less understood what happened when I hit **command-option-i**, but that advice kept echoing in my head and it occurred to me that it must be worth digging deeper, since it was one of only two specific pieces of software that he mentioned.

I figured I'd check and see if there was a decent tutorial on Chrome DevTools and found [this incredible series](http://zfer.us/q1OmQ) on CodeSchool.

The most often-used thing for CSS work is probably going to be **inspect element**, but the ability to edit code in DevTools with instant preview and save changes locally, revert (if necessary) and eventually save over the original file is pretty cool. There's even code auto-complete for CSS properties in the editor. If you were writing pure HTML/CSS, you could almost use Chrome as a complete development environment. Color me impressed.
