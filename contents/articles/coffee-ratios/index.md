I'm working through some jQuery tutorials at the moment and just wanted to get away from the practice files and make something simple, so that I'm applying what I'm learning to my own code. I actually have a native mobile app that calculates coffee ratios, but I wanted a back-up solution, in case my phone isn't nearby or the battery is dead.

I plan on adding some features to it later, such as the ability to change measurement units, the coffee to water ratio, and maybe a slider for data input... but this works for now.

As a side note, I'm really loving [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) right now. I had resorted to writing plain old CSS in CodePen and then I realized that CodePen lets you use Sass and that it automatically loads Compass for you and even lets you choose to load CSS normalize or CSS reset files automatically. Pretty much, if you can think of something that would be cool, CodePen probably already does it.

This is making me seriously look at CodePen Pro, as the [Live View](http://blog.codepen.io/documentation/pro-features/live-view/) across devices and browsers seems pretty useful, as well as the ability to host images, audio and video files on CodePen. This makes it an even handier sketch pad for front-end ideas. No need to create files, link them up, add them to CodeKit, and create a Git repository just to tinker with some JavaScript or CSS.
