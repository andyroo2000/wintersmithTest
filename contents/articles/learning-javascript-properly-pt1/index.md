Only a few days have passed since embarking on my mission to [learn JavaScript properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/).

The schedule for the first two weeks was mostly review, so I was able to get through the first several chapters of my book [Professional JavaScript for Web Developers](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) in a few days.

I'm now on Chapter 5 and I've been going through all of the important methods for strings and arrays on [devdocs.io](http://devdocs.io/), which is a very nice looking interface for the Mozilla Dev Docs. I've been trying to spend enough time playing with each of the methods to create some muscle memory, so that I don't have to look up syntax for basic methods. The part of Chapter 5 that is going to take a little longer is the section on regular expressions. While I continue to move through the JavaScript book, I'm going to spend a little time each day working through [Zed Shaw's](http://www.zedshaw.com) book on regular expressions, called: [Learn Regex the Hard Way](http://regex.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

I've also been digging into open source projects on GitHub and trying to get a feel for JavaScript formatting conventions. I really like the jQuery style of adding extra spaces inside tokens such as parentheses, braces, brackets and semicolons. I find it to be extremely easy to read, so it seems like a good style to copy for now. I'm not totally sure why this hasn't caught on more.

And now for the boring stuff: I've been using SublimeText again... although I've been using it in Vintage Mode (i.e. with Vim keybindings). The only thing that I miss from *actual* Vim (vs. Vintage Mode in Sublime) is ctrl-R. Ctrl-R would allow you to type over characters without inserting new spaces. It's a very handy mode, and it's a little sad that it's not implemented in Vintage Mode. Hopefully, someone will add this little bit of functionality. Unfortunately, I'm way too busy learning JS stuff to start messing with writing Sublime plugins right now.

I've also gotten with it and installed some of the more useful Sublime plugins, like [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter), which makes a box around my JavaScript in realtime if there are any missing semicolons etc. And for this blog (which I write in Markdown), I installed a spellchecking plugin called [CheckBounce](https://github.com/phyllisstein/CheckBounce), which works great and keeps me from looking like an illiterate git when I inevitably make a spelling error.

The last Sublime plugin I installed was [Dayle Rees Colour Schemes](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes). It's a plugin that you can install with package manager that adds about 50 color schemes to your menu. There are many classics and I'm currently enjoying [Snappy Light](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes/blob/master/screenshots/snappylight.png).



At some point, I should make a post about some of my Sublime key bindings. Most of them won't blow any minds, but I'm pretty happy with how I have split-screen buffers mapped out. Perhaps next time...

I should probably get some rest. I have another day of coding tomorrow and then I'm going to a MeetUp that I bought tickets for several weeks ago: [Full-stack Web Development with Node.js](http://www.meetup.com/codecrewny/events/136333482/).
