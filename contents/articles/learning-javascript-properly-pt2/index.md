Days have passed and I've been mostly busy going through coding challenges on sites like [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com) that deal with string and array manipulation.

The first few problems took me a while to solve, but they start to become easy after you do enough of them. It's kind of like how crosswords become easier once you get used to that way of thinking about problem solving.

I'm finally getting comfortable enough with array and string methods that I can solve the problems without having to check for the syntax on how to splice (one of the *most* useful array methods) or to remember to use `()` instead of `[]` when retrieving the index of a character in a string using `charAt()`.

I'm dipping my toes into objects as well, but I'm having so much fun doing these problems that I want to spend a few more days digging into them before moving onto objects. I'm also just getting into sorting and trying some sorting algorithms. I remember being so confused by this stuff only a few months ago.

I also started peeking at [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) on the train yesterday and I've finally reached the milestone of being able to understand what's so great about this book.

The most disturbing thing that happened to me recently is that I've started to read things like the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) in my spare time. I'm not sure how I feel about 2 spaces for JavaScript, but I'm blown away by how thorough the guide is. It's a very impressive piece of documentation with clear examples and it contains many JS tips for me (i.e. best practices and things that are probably a good idea).

As for my self-imposed plan for beefing up my JavaScript fundamentals, I'm still a little ahead of my [6 week schedule](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly). I'm glad I put the schedule on my Google Calendar, since it keeps me from rushing ahead too fast and feeling overwhelmed. Although, I have to say that I'm very happy that I will be reintroduced to jQuery this week, as I've been itching to start hitting the DOM again, and after learning how it's done in raw JavaScript and writing special functions for cross-browser JavaScript, I'm totally seeing why jQuery is so popular.
