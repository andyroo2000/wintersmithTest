This is my first post using Wintersmith.

For some reason, I've never been satisfied with blogging platforms. They all
kind of do the job, but they all seem to have drawbacks that become clear after
using them for a while.

I've used blogger, tumblr, wordpress, Jekyll, and ghost. So far, Jekyll came
closest to meeting my needs.

#### Pros for Jekyll

- I can write posts in markdown in Vim -> max productivity and focus
- Renders static pages for a very speedy site
- Nothing you don't need

#### Cons for Jekyll

- Can be finicky about your Ruby and gem installations. Mine was working fine
  for a while and then inexplicably stopped working at some point.
- Uses (kind of whack) Liquid templating language. Ugh, I really don't feel like
  learning another goofy templating language that no one seems to like very much
  and that no other project seems to use just to modify my blog layout.

That said, Jekyll is very close to perfect and I really can't knock it.

### What Does Wintersmith do Differently?

I've just started to play around with it, so I can't give my final word on it,
but I will say that Wintersmith seems to retain the pros of Jekyll, while
addressing the cons.

First of all, we are safely in JavaScript Land. I'm not doing much Ruby now, so
it's nice to not worry about spending half a day getting my Ruby gems to play nice
with Jekyll. Thinking in JavaScript from end to end is delightful.

Secondly, I can use my sweet, sweet Jade templating engine, which I already know
and love and stop wasting time trying to wrangle Liquid to do things that it
doesn't want to do.

### The Future

I know I've said this before, but this time I mean it (for a little while)...
I think this is my blogging home for the foreseeable future.
