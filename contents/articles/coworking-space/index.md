I can finally stop paying too much for Starbucks coffee and listening to the same Starbucks mixes over and over again...

I found a coworking space in Brooklyn that is pleasant and very affordable called [Bat Hause](http://batha.us/). I'm loving the neighborhood and the fact that [Los Hermanos](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/dining/reviews/11unde.html?loadDynamically=false&commentsPosition=right&_r=0) is next door.

Today, I finished some jQuery tutorials and added a little bit of pizazz to my coffee calculator.
